    "# CSCI 3022: Intro to Data Science - Summer 2018 Practicum \n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "This practicum is due on Moodle by **11:55 PM on Monday July 23**. Your solutions to theoretical questions should be done in Markdown/MathJax directly below the associated question.  Your solutions to computational questions should include any specified Python code and results as well as written commentary on your conclusions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are the rules:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. All work, code and analysis, must be your own. \n",
    "1. You may use your course notes, posted lecture slides, textbooks, in-class notebooks, and homework solutions as resources.  You may also search online for answers to general knowledge questions like the form of a probability distribution function or how to perform a particular operation in Python/Pandas. \n",
    "1. This is meant to be like a coding portion of your final exam. So, I will be much less helpful than I typically am with homework. For example, I will not check answers, help debug your code, and so on.\n",
    "1. If something is left open-ended, it is probably because I intend for you to code it up however you want, and only care about the plots/analysis I see at the end. Feel free to ask clarifying questions though.\n",
    "2. You may **NOT** post to message boards or other online resources asking for help.\n",
    "3. You may **NOT** copy-paste solutions *from anywhere*.\n",
    "4. You may **NOT** collaborate with classmates or anyone else.  \n",
    "5. In short, **your work must be your own**. It really is that simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of the above rules will result in an immediate academic sanction (*at the very least*, you will receive a 0 on the practicum or an F in the course, depending on severity), and a trip to the Honor Code Council.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**By writing your name below you agree to abide by the rules given above:**\n",

    "\n",
    "- You may not use late days on the practicum nor can you drop your practicum grade. \n",
    "- If you have a question for Tony, post it as a **PRIVATE** message on Piazza.  If I decide that the question is appropriate for the entire class I add it to a Practicum clarifications thread. \n",
    "- Do **NOT** load or use any Python packages that are not available in Anaconda 3.6. \n",
    "- Some problems with code may be autograded.  If we provide a function API **do not** change it.  If we do not provide a function API then you're free to structure your code however you like. \n",
    "- Submit only this Jupyter notebook to Moodle.  Do not compress it using tar, rar, zip, etc. \n",
    "- This should go without saying, but... For any question that asks you to calculate something, you **must show all work to receive credit**. Sparse or nonexistent work will receive sparse or nonexistent credit.\n",

    "* Assume that the probability of knocking down a single pin is a parameter $p$.\n",

In Markdown/MathJax, you must name and fully justify your choice of distribution and other modeling choices.
