    "The data suggest that there was male chivalry, but not so much class warfare during the sinking of the titanic. This is because there is not a significant difference in the number of survivors in each class (the number of survivors in first class was equal to that in third class, all classes made up about a third of the survivors each). However, there is a bias toward female survivors (Part D) and younger survivors (Parts E and F). This suggests that the young and females had a higher chance of suvival and is evidence for male chivalry."
