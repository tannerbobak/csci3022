Calculate **exactly** (aside from rounding) the probability that he serves 100 or more customers during his shift.  Be sure to justify any assumptions or extrapolations that you make."

    "**Part E**:  Write a function `checkout_count` to simulate the number of customers served by the self check-out machine in a 4-hour shift. At the very least, your function should take as input the working and broken customer arrival rate parameters, and the probability that the machine is working properly. Use this function to estimate the probability of the self check-out machine serves 100 or more customers in a 4-hour shift, and report your result.\n",

    "Here, your simulation should model the arrival of each new customer, and sample whether or not the machine is working properly for each new customer. Then, your function should simulate customer arrival times at the front of the line by sampling between-customer times from $Exp(\\lambda)$ via Numpy's [random.exponential](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.exponential.html) function, where the argument $\\lambda$ will depend on the state of the machine (working or broken). Your function should return the number of customer arrivals in a 4-hour shift. Use at least 5000 simulations.\n",
