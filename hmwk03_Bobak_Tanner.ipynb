There are only two lines open; one is being tended by a cashier named [John Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)), and the other is tended by a [self check-out machine](https://theconversation.com/the-economics-of-self-service-checkouts-78593). Like all human beings when they arrive at the front of the store to check-out and encounter lines everywhere, you first experience a moment of intense panic. _Which line will be the fastest?_ you wonder, as people shuffle around you.\n",

    "You decide you need to model the arrival of customers at the front of each of the lines.  From your Intro to Data Science class you remember that the distribution of times _between_ independent arrivals is often modeled using an Exponential distribution.  You stand at the front of the store watching the two lines and tabulating the inter-arrival times for each line and find the following:\n",
    "* John's line checks-out an average of 2 customers per five-minute time slice,\n",
    "* the self check-out machine checks-out an average of 2.5 customers per five-minute time slice **if** the machine is working properly, \n",
    "* the self check-out machine checks-out an average of 1 customer per five-minute time slice if the machine is freezing up, and\n",
    "* the self check-out machine froze up for 2 of the 10 five-minute time slices you observed it.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Part A**:  Assuming the between-customer times do in-fact follow exponential distributions, what distributions do you expect the **number** of customers who pass through each line in a given 5-minute interval to follow?  What are the parameter(s) of each distribution?  Note that you should consider both the case where the self check-out is working properly and when it is broken."

At the very least, your function should take as input the working and broken customer arrival rate parameters, and the probability that the machine is working properly. Use this function to estimate the probability of the self check-out machine serves 100 or more customers in a 4-hour shift, and report your result.\n",

    "Here, your simulation should model the arrival of each new customer, and sample whether or not the machine is working properly for each new customer. Then, your function should simulate customer arrival times at the front of the line by sampling between-customer times from $Exp(\\lambda)$ via Numpy's [random.exponential](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.exponential.html) function, where the argument $\\lambda$ will depend on the state of the machine (working or broken). Your function should return the number of customer arrivals in a 4-hour shift. Use at least 5000 simulations.\n",
