On any given pitch, the probability that you hit the ball is only about 0.05. Your friend needs to know when she'll be able to go home, so she wants to estimate the distribution of the number of balls she will need to throw by the time you get your 10th hit. Luckily, you are better at Data Science than you are at baseball!\n",
